          <h2 class="mb-4 font-mono text-xl font-medium text-white">1. Statutory Right of Withdrawal (EU/EEA Consumers)</h2>
          <p>If you are a consumer in the EU/EEA and purchase GDAgent online, you generally have a <strong>14-day right of withdrawal</strong> for distance contracts.</p>
          <p><strong>Exception for digital content:</strong> The right of withdrawal expires early if you expressly agree that we begin performance before the end of the withdrawal period and acknowledge that you thereby lose your right of withdrawal (Directive 2011/83/EU; implemented in national law).</p>
          <p>If the right of withdrawal applies, you can withdraw within 14 days without giving any reason. The withdrawal period begins on the day of contract conclusion.</p>
