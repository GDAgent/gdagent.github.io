## Tabs

Each tab is an independent terminal running an AI agent. You can have multiple tabs open simultaneously — useful for:

- Working on different features in parallel
- Comparing outputs from different AI tools
- Keeping a reference conversation while starting a new one

### Tab Actions

- **New Tab** — Click **+** or use the keyboard shortcut
- **Close Tab** — Click the **×** on the tab, or use the shortcut
- **Rename Tab** — Right-click the tab to rename it
- **Reorder Tabs** — Drag tabs to rearrange

## Sessions

Sessions group related tabs together. Think of them as workspaces for different tasks or features.

### Creating Sessions

Click the session dropdown and select **New Session**. Give it a descriptive name like "Player Movement" or "UI Refactor".

### Switching Sessions

Use the session dropdown to switch between sessions. Each session remembers its tabs and their state.

### Session Persistence

Sessions are automatically saved. When you reopen Godot, your sessions and tabs are restored.

## Split View

Work with two terminals side by side:

1. Open at least two tabs
2. Right-click a tab and select **Split with...**
3. Choose the second tab

Drag the divider to adjust the split ratio.
