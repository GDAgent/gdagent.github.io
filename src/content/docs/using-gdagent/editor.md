The GDAgent panel lives in Godot's bottom dock, alongside the Output and Debugger panels.

## The Terminal

GDAgent provides a full terminal emulator inside Godot. Your AI coding assistant runs here with complete access to your project files.

The terminal supports:
- Full ANSI colors and formatting
- Scrollback history

- OpenCode

Select one and it launches with your project directory as the working directory.
