title: "Introducing GDAgent: Bringing AI to the Godot Editor"
description: "Launch day is here. GDAgent puts native AI terminal workflows directly inside Godot so you can ship faster without context switching."

Every Godot developer knows this loop:

1. Hit a problem in-editor.
2. Switch to a browser tab.
3. Paste code into an AI assistant.
4. Copy the response back into Godot.
5. Repeat.

That context switching breaks flow. GDAgent exists to remove it.

## Why we built GDAgent

GDAgent started as an internal tool to keep AI help where development actually happens: inside Godot.

Instead of embedding a web view, we built a native terminal experience in the bottom dock so CLI-based AI tools can run directly in your project workflow.

## What is available today

- Native terminal in Godot (Rust + GDExtension backend)
- Persistent AI sessions across editor restarts
- Split and grid layouts for multi-agent workflows
- First Run Wizard for quick setup
- Prompt templates for common Godot tasks
- One-click install through GDAgent Manager

Supported tools include Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Aider, GitHub Copilot CLI, Mistral Vibe, OpenAI Codex CLI, and OpenCode.

## Pricing at launch

- Individual license: $8.99 one-time (normally $9.99)
- 3-day free trial with full access
- 2 machine activations per license
- 30-day money-back guarantee

Launch code: `LAUNCH10` for an additional 10% off for a limited time.

## What comes next

Current roadmap priorities include:

- macOS support (Intel + Apple Silicon)
- Godot MCP server for deeper project interaction
- Project-aware context indexing
- Auto-snapshots before AI edits

## Try it and tell us what to build

If you are building with Godot, try GDAgent and tell us where it helps most and where it still gets in the way.
